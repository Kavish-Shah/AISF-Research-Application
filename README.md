Discovery of Optimal Algorithm for Bipedal Walker

## Experiments & Scripts

* **`train_baseline.py`**: The initial boilerplate PPO solution generated by Gemini 3.
* **`train_tuning.py`**: An attempt to improve performance via manual hyperparameter tuning.
* **`train_rewarding.py`**: Implements custom reward shaping to incentivize movement in the positive x-direction.
* **`train_normalization.py`**: Uses observation normalization combined with a larger network architecture (`[400, 300]`).
* **`train_optimal.py`** *(Best Implementation)*: Uses observation normalization with the default network size (`[64, 64]`), achieving the highest stability and sample efficiency.
