train_baseline is the boilerplate PPO spit out by Gemini 3.
train_tuning is the approach of hyperparameter tuning.
train_rewarding is approach of reward crafting for movement in the positive x-direction. 
train_normalization is the approach of normalization with a larger network than the default.
train_optimal is the approach of normalization with a default network size. (the best implementation)
